============================================================
BEL Framework 2.0.0 (June 2012)
============================================================

Upgrading to the 2.0.0 Release
--------------------------------------

- Package renaming breaks client code that uses the Java API.  Change
"com.selventa.belframework.api" to "org.openbel.framework.api" to update client
code.
- The context name of the Web Service server changed from BELFrameworkWebAPI to
openbel-ws.  The default URL is now http://localhost:8080/openbel-ws/
- The Java API has been reorganized into a simple package for clarity.  Consult
the javadocs at: http://openbel.github.com/openbel-framework/

Upgrading to the 1.3.0 Release
--------------------------------------

This release includes significant speed increases to the BEL Framework Java API
and BEL Framework Web API in terms of equivalencing and search capabilities.
BELFramework 1.3.0 requires your KAMs to be recompiled in order to rely on
these increases.

The KamManager tool has been introduced to provide a canonical tool for
KAMStore management and reporting.  This tool has consolidated the following
tools supported in BEL Framework 1.2.4 and earlier:
  * KamImporter   (use "KamManager.sh/KamManager.cmd --import")
  * KamExporter   (use "KamManager.sh/KamManager.cmd --export")
  * KamSummarizer (use "KamManager.sh/KamManager.cmd --summarize")

See the changelog for more information on the KamManager tool.

BEL Framework 1.3.0 no longer includes the DocStore and BEL Workbench.

The DocStore has been removed without an alternative, but it is still possible
to convert between BEL and XBEL using the DocumentConverter tool that ships
with the BEL Framework.

The BEL Workbench has been superseded by the open-source OpenBEL Workbench
knowledge management tool.  For more information go to:

Upgrading to the 1.2.4 Release
--------------------------------------

This release includes new updates to version 1.0 of the BEL namespaces and
equivalences.  It is advised to recompile your KAM to take advantage of the new
data.

Upgrading to the 1.2.3 Release
--------------------------------------

This release contained some KAM structural changes.  It is advised to recompile
your KAM to take advantage of these enhancements.

Additionally some performance improvements were made to the resource cache
which requires your cache to be rebuilt.  Run the CacheManager tool to purge
and refresh your resource cache.

Upgrading to the 1.2.2 Release
--------------------------------------

This release fixes duplicate parameters stored for KAM nodes.  It is advised to
recompile your KAM to work properly with the Java and Web APIs.

Upgrading to the 1.2.0 Release
--------------------------------------

This release included structural changes to the KAM schema in order to
associate multiple KAM edges with multiple statements and to improve the
retrieval of nested statements.  The V1.2.0 will only work with KAMs compiled
using the 1.2.0 version of the BEL Compiler so you must recompile your
BEL documents.
