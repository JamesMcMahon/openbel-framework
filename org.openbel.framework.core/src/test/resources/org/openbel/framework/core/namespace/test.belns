DescriptionString=This namespace list that names of protein complexes that are frequently used and/or are well characterized. Each named complex may be associated with a defined set of complex components (complex components are defined in BEL documents using BEL statements elsewhere). This namespace serves to standardize the representation of a complex by providing a standardized name. This name may also be associated with a defined set of complex components. However there is no requirement that a named complex has complex components associated with it; it can simply represent the concept of the complex.
